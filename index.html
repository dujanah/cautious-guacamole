Critical geography of urban
agriculture

Abstract
Urban agriculture is a broad term which describes food cultivation and animal husbandry on urban and
peri-urban land. Grassroots as well as institution-led urban agricultural projects are currently mushrooming in the cities of the Global North, reshaping urban landscapes, experimenting with alternatives to the
capitalist organization of urban life and sometimes establishing embryonic forms of recreating the Commons. While this renewed interest in land cultivation and food production is attracting increasing interest
in a wide range of disciplines – from planning to landscape and cultural studies – it remains a very marginal
and almost unexplored field of human geography. Nonetheless, beyond the rhetoric of sustainability and
health, urban agriculture raises several relevant questions of interest for a critical geographer. Starting
by drawing a map of concepts and theories available in an interdisciplinary literature, and highlighting fields
of possible inquiry, this paper aims to define the scope of and an initial agenda for a critical geography of
urban agriculture.

I Introduction
This paper aims to define the scope of – and an
initial agenda for – a critical geography of urban
agriculture (UA). UA is defined as ‘the growing, processing, and distribution of food and
other products through intensive plant cultivation and animal husbandry in and around cities’
(Urban Agriculture Committee of the CFSC,
2003:3). It includes small-intensive urban
farms, food production on housing estates, land
sharing, rooftop gardens and beehives, schoolyard greenhouses, restaurant-supported salad
gardens, public space food production, guerrilla
gardening, allotments, balcony and windowsill
vegetable growing and other initiatives (Hou
et al., 2009; Mougeot, 2005; Nordahl, 2009;
Redwood, 2008).
UA is a common practice in many cities of
the Global South. In the cities of the Global
North, people’s engagement with food production has been marginalized and limited in ways
that vary between countries and cities, with relevant exceptions during world conflicts (e.g. the
‘Dig for Victory’ campaign). However, we are
currently witnessing a great resurgence of UA.

movement, the many local groups harvesting
plants in public space and distributing the produce (Reynolds, 2008; Tracey, 2007): these are
just a few examples of an extraordinary list of
visionary and innovative projects promoted by
single individuals, community organizations,
local councils, universities, charities, cooperatives and social enterprises. Many of these are
also exemplary practices explicitly addressing
urban food provision and food rights, individual
and communal health, urban and peri-urban environmental quality and socio-environmental justice (Sonnino, 2009). Projects like ‘P-Patch’ in
Seattle, ‘Growing Power’ in Milwaukee or
‘DUG’ in Denver, for example, combining measures such as the establishment of land trusts, the
organization of training programmes and links
with existing food outlets, have become reference
points for the food justice movement. They have
not only been granting access to urban land for the
recreational and food production needs of immigrants and other food-insecure populations, but
have been systematically challenging the concentration of land, and other inequities embedded in
the dominant agriculture and food systems, such
as environmental impact, health hazards and the
exploitation of workers (Gottlieb and Joshi,
2009: 149).
Some UA projects in post-industrial cities are
even playing with the urban form, challenging
current land-use management and ownership,
reinventing the urban landscape, and experimenting with radical alternatives to the capitalist
neoliberal organization of urban life (Tornaghi,
2011, 2012a). An example of this kind is ‘Grow
Heathrow’, a food-growing project on the outskirts of London which represents an innovative
example of grassroots-designed sustainable living space and a new urban common. Started during a mobilization against the construction of
Heathrow Airport’s third runway, the project is
located in the derelict greenhouses of a former
market garden in the heart of Sipson village.
These spaces are now creatively integrating
facilities for political meetings and conviviality
with raised beds, camping areas, plant nurseries,
bike workshops and cooking.
Some of the changes and claims proposed by
these projects – for example, a call for environmentally sound farming practices or land reform
which satisfies the need for affordable and
accessible cultivable land – have become evident to different governing institutions. In the
UK, for example, in March 2010 the Labour
government announced that so-called ‘underused and uncared-for land’ would be given to
local communities in order to help meet the
unmet demand of 100,000 people on allotment
waiting lists and enable them to grow their own
food (Communities and Local Government,
2010). In the same month, a supplementary document to ‘Growing in the community’ (a wellknown guide for allotment officers) was released
by the Local Government Association to guide
local councils on how to deal with the growing
demand for land (Wiltshire and LGA, 2010).
This came just days after the London Assembly
Planning and Housing Committee published the
report ‘Cultivating the capital: Food growing and
the planning system in London’ (LAPHC, 2010).
While land has not been distributed, rising pressures to engage with climate change and food
security are putting local food-growing and food
planning on the agendas of a number of cities.
Urban agricultural practices are being portrayed as benevolent and unproblematic, with the
potential to partially solve problems associated
with food quality and affordability, reduce ecological footprints, increase community cohesion,
achieve greater community resilience and promote urban sustainability. However, many controversial and potentially unjust dynamics lie
unexplored.
While many food-growing projects are mushrooming around cities of the Global North, often
funded by ‘greening’ agendas – in what Jackson
(2009) has termed the Keynesian ‘Green New
Deal’ – or health preventative measures which
form a prelude to conspicuous public budget
cuts, we know very little of how effectively these
552 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
initiatives are achieving their aims. How do they
contextually fit in the overall geography of austerity, selling of council land and cuts to council
budgets? Is access to urban land for food-growing
guaranteed across the spectrum of society? Are
the management arrangements for the use of
public land preventing the rise of new forms
of enclosures and gentrification? What is the
role of UA initiatives in increasing the value
and attractiveness of undeveloped inner-city
areas? Are the urban food-growing spaces included within urban new developments of a substantial size to feed the new residents, or do they
just provide a ‘green wash’ to revamp the realestate market? Are the grassroots attempts to
establish urban food commons equally well
regarded by national and local governments?
What role are urban agricultural projects playing in the more regressive cases of rescaling of
urban ecological security (Hodson and Marvin,
2009; Whitehead, 2013)? While UA projects
undoubtedly provide an opportunity for many
urban dwellers to reconnect with food production, we need to scrutinize more closely the
way these initiatives are becoming, directly
or indirectly, new tools or justifications for a
new wave of capital accumulation (new green
development), economic-growth-led policies
(local food as a tool in city autarky), privatization of the urban realm (Big Society takes over
the management of public assets) and disinvestments in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
(cuts to health and wellbeing services, public
space management, etc.).
If we look carefully, there is already empirical
evidence of these forms of socio-environmental
injustice taking shape across Europe, but a specific assessment can only be contextual and built
on a wider view of regulatory frameworks, the
range of policies and the actual engagement of
civil society.
The academic community so far has paid little attention to this social practice and its cultural, economic and social dimensions. While
a geography of food has consolidated in recent
years, particularly within cultural and consumption studies (Atkins and Bowler, 2000; Cook
et al., 2008), an analysis of the specific geography of urban food cultivation and its relations
with the politics of space is still a neglected field
of human and urban geography, with a handful
of journal articles as exceptions (Blomley,
2004; Wekerle, 2004).
My aim in this paper is to initiate a critical
approach to UA which, in continuity with the
work of radical scholars on the social production of space (namely Lefebvre, Harvey and
Marcuse), and within a political ecology framework, aims to ‘[expose] the forms of power,
exclusion, injustice and inequality’ (Brenner,
2009: 200) that frame or that are potentially
embedded into these place-making practices
and ‘to explore the possibility of forging alternatives’ (p. 200). While most of the existing literature on the topic has a clear advocacy intent,
I am calling for a critical approach which puts UA
initiatives in the context of specific sociopolitical
(and food) regimes, and investigates the role that
they play in the reproduction of capitalism, in the
transformation of urban metabolic processes, and
in the discursive, political and physical production of new socio-environmental conditions
(Heynen et al., 2006; McMichael, 2009). Within
this approach, I call for an understanding of how
UA initiatives contribute to perpetrate new forms
of injustice or open the way to subvert current
forms of urbanization through the implementation of new ecologically sound and just forms of
living and/or the reconstruction of the urban commons (Hodkinson, 2012).
While UA might be an interesting topic to be
investigated from a cultural perspective, my aim
here is to stress the importance of an analysis
which is ‘geographical’ in its sensitivities. The
starting point for this endeavour is an understanding of existing urbanization in the Global North
as a process dominated by capital accumulation
which in the past four centuries has appropriated,
enclosed and compromised the natural environment, and naturalized the commercialization of
Tornaghi 553
land, depriving human beings of the right to feed
themselves through the unconditional use of
their surrounding space (Heynen, 2010). Modern urban dwellers, trapped within the chronic
insufficiency of tenable urban agricultural land
(including allotments and home gardens), unfavourable regulations on animal farming, and the
time requirements of waged jobs, are to a great
extent subjugated to the industrial agro-food
system, commercializing food whose provenance may not be transparent and may not be
in line with urban dwellers’ ethical views. Western urbanization has not only established a
structural dependency on unsustainable forms
of exploitation of natural resources (oil extraction, greenhouse gas emissions, massive use of
fertilizers and pesticides) to be able to sustain its
population (McMichael, 2009; Shiva, 2008;
Steel, 2008) but is progressively extending this
model across the planet through a new range of
forms of dispossession, land enclosures and
cheap labour (McMichael, 2012). Within this
context, UA not only plays a role in the envisioning of alternative forms of urbanization which
reconcile activities of production and reproduction, and break with the urban-rural dichotomy,
but may also play a role in the geopolitics of food.
Aware of these dynamics, and acknowledging the complexity of sociopolitical and economic factors which contribute to configure
western urban landscapes, I believe we need to
develop a critical geography of UA motivated
by two sets of reasons. The first is the need
to unveil how issues of socio-environmental
justice and inequality are embedded in UA as
a form of place-making, and systematically
explore the spatial opportunities for a radical
remaking of the urban. The four parts in section
II of this paper will draw on existing literature to
call for new analytical endeavours and simultaneously unveiling spheres in which different
forms of injustice – either as distributional justice, procedural justice or context-based capability justice (Nussbaum and Sen, 1993) – take
place.
The second set of reasons for a critical geography of UA revolves around the major global
challenge of food security. In the light of climate change, increased energy costs and demographic pressure on the one hand and financial
speculation in food commodities on the other
(Kaufman, 2010), governments and city authorities are expecting a significant rise in food
prices, if not food shortages. While land grabbing in the Global South is becoming a worrying
and fast-growing phenomenon, UA is becoming
a compelling field of investigation in search of
sustainable alternatives for food security on a
planet in which the majority of the population
lives in cities. Given the political and strategic
role which UA can play in the future, the development of its critical theorization will set the
parameters for evaluating what type of initiatives are fit for non-regressive and socially just
urban food policies.
To develop this agenda, in the next section I
will start by drawing a map of the theoretical
contributions currently available in a multidisciplinary perspective for the analysis of UA, identifying their analytical limitations. In section III,
I will then more systematically define the scope,
questions and research agenda for a critical geography of UA.
II Analysing urban agriculture
history and current trends:
a multi disciplinary literature
The first and most evident problem when
approaching the literature on UA is its overwhelming focus on cities in the Global South:
I refer, for example, to the work of Mougeot
(2005), Obosu-Mensah (1999) and Redwood
(2008). While there is potential to learn from
their regulatory frameworks (i.e. the way planning regulations conceive of food production
in urban contexts), these contributions concern
urban realities quite distant from those characterizing the post-industrial Global North. Not
only are Global North and South experiencing
554 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
different degrees of population growth and triple
crunch effects, they have also different histories
of ‘eviction’ or marginalization of farming from
cities, different food consumption styles and a
different manifestation of back-to-the-land exodus (Halfacree, 2006; Kaufman and Bailkey,
2000) or, to use an expression of Lefebvre
(1991 [1974]), dis-alienation strategies.
A second problem of the existing literature on
UA in the Global North is its narrow confinement
within disciplinary fields. While social economy,
landscape architecture and food planning are the
first disciplinary fields to consider UA as a matter of inquiry, the existing contributions are particularly prone to an advocacy attitude which
probably helps to bring the issue to the attention
of the press, but which reinforces a benign and
uncritical approach rather than one which should
ultimately inform socio-environmentally just
policy-making.
Navigating within the literature it is nonetheless possible to critically explore the field, weaving reconnections, exposing disconnections. In
this section I organize my argument along four
analytical blocks: (1) the sociopolitical history
of the urban form; (2) the multilayered meanings
of food-growing which reconnect urban gardening and agriculture; (3) the emerging food system
policy field and its dis-connection with food
ethics, consumption and land access; and (4) the
recent western ‘sustainability-environmental turn’
which tends to incorporate commoditized versions
of urban agricultural practices while perpetrating
socio-environmental exclusion. While these four
analytical blocks emerge out of a multidisciplinary literature, they will constitute the basis for the
geographical configuration of a research agenda
on UA which will be outlined in section III of this
paper.
1 Rise and demise of agriculture in urban
contexts: a sociopolitical history
A first step for understanding the conjunctural
meaning of UA in cities of the Global North is
tracking its rise and demise within the sociopolitical history of urban settlements, its form and
management. Why is UA today mainly perceived as a residual practice? How did the space
for agricultural practices evolve within planning
models and theories, and what happened to their
implementation? We learn from historians like
Kostof that agricultural activities were at the
very core of the foundation itself of new colonies since Greek and Roman times (Kostof,
1991) and several other contributions in the
recent book Gardening: Philosophy for Everyone (O’Brien, 2010a) give a good account of
some of the early gardens in Mediterranean and
Middle Eastern societies, their productivity,
aesthetic and philosophy. Far from being simply
an agglomeration of craftsmen, trading businesses and power structures, ancient cities
incorporated farmers and farming land (Kostof,
1991). Even in medieval times, when walls and
defensive structures left out most of the farming
land, agricultural patches were available among
the buildings and next to the city walls (CockrallKing, 2012; Howe et al., 2005; Steel, 2008). Steel
(2008) and Van der Schans and Wiskerke (2012)
briefly sketch the making of the urban-rural
divide in pre-industrial time and the disappearance of intensive farming from cities in connection with transport facilities and the relocation
of the agricultural service industry.
What we do not know is how, in specific historical and geographical contexts, urban farming
has been banned from urban settlements and how
these trends have been resisted and opposed.
Pressure of urban development and population
growth? Enclosures of common land and dispossession? Enforcement of health and nuisance regulations? Development of national
planning laws?
To track this history we need a critical geography of UA which is able to connect at least
three disciplinary fields: (1) the history of land
tenure regimes from pre-feudal time to modern
days, which accounts for land privatization,
enclosures of the commons and rural to urban
Tornaghi 555
migrations, on the example of the British history of enclosures and the Diggers movement
(Bradley, 2009; Fairlie, 2009); (2) the history
of colonialism and imperialism and their
impact on specific national agricultural markets, which accounts for transformations in
local agricultural systems and urban food provision, as well as for food commodification,
changes in families’ food allocation and backyard gardening habits; and (3) the history of
planning ideas and their specific development
into national planning systems, which accounts
for application of modernist concepts of health
and functionality to urban living space, and for
citizens’ deprivation of the right to determine
the shape and functions of their living environments. The hypothesis is that the specific combination of these three spheres – land tenures,
agricultural markets/food regimes and planning
systems, can explain to a large extent the contemporary urban form, its functions and the residual
space of UA.
Literature on UA has only timidly started to
look at these fields and their connections (Van
der Schans and Wiskerke, 2012). While there
is a recent interest in visionary city models such
as Howard’s Garden City, searching for sustainable urban settings which incorporate foodgrowing in urban dwelling (McKay, 2011), we
also need to critically assess the responsibilities
of utopian city models in the marginalization of
UA. It is arguably with the artificial separation
of life spheres (i.e. dwelling, working and leisure) in modernist planning ideas that criteria
of hygiene and sanitization merged into planning systems and forms of urbanization based
on blueprint urban zoning and disempowerment
of local communities from place-making.
Whether this was due to the original planning
model or to its imperfect implementation, the
result is that the production of food at the family
level is not contemplated and the whole food
chain is completely invisible. Henri Lefebvre,
back in 1974, highlighted the co-optation of science by the interests of power, and marked the
affirmation of modern planning ideas into his
history of spatialization (Lefebvre, 1991
[1974]). In his work he has also made clear the
fundamental nature of modern urbanization, its
key role in the second circuit of capital and the
consequent, ongoing and never-ending alienation of the rural. Neoliberalism has taken this
approach forward, promoting and normalizing
‘a growth-first approach to urban development’
(Peck and Tickell, 2002: 394), which, by its
very nature, consolidates the marginalization
of urban food production. A contextual sociopolitical history of UA should build on these
standpoints.
While western cities were undergoing processes of modernization and renewal organized
according to separation and zoning, and were left
with a landscape of green spaces made primarily
of private home gardens, front lawns, unproductive parks and residual green bits along railways
or streets, or in peripheral areas, it is nonetheless
during this period that many western cities witnessed a resurgence of food-growing spaces of
a different kind. Some of these were predominantly spontaneous and illegal – for example, the
patches of land at the periphery of many Italian
industrial cities – and represent the fulfilment
of land attachment and food-growing habits of
workers who moved to the city from rural areas.
Most of these insurgent growing spaces have
eventually been regularized into public allotment
provision after a few decades. In other European
contexts internal migration is less central in the
establishment of regulated and systematic urban
agricultural sites, such as allotments, and these
were rather the legacy of wartime food shortages.
Some accounts of how these spaces are cultivated today and how their meanings are changing
over time have become available in recent years.
Crouch and Ward (1988) give us the most complete overview of allotment sites in Europe.
Beyond this, we have a few other contributions
that help us understand how UA unfolds in contemporary cities: Buckingham (2005) investigates the gendering of allotment tending and
556 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
points out a relatively recent increase in women’s
engagement with this practice in the UK; Zavisca
(2003) gives us an overview of the cultural and
political meaning of food cultivation in the
peri-urban Russian dachas; and Poole (2006)
provides us with a detailed history of allotment
institutionalization in the UK. A little more
prolific is the literature on American ‘community gardens’ – spaces generally more similar
to allotment sites than to genuinely collectively
run spaces – of which Hou et al. (2009) and
Lawson (2005) are the most substantial
contributions.
However, beyond allotment gardening, signs
of UA are increasingly appearing in front lawns,
kitchen gardens, pavement verges, railway embankments and other interstitial spaces through
guerrilla gardening and more or less conflictual
projects reclaiming the land for food production. While the guerrilla gardening movement
has his own manifesto which tracks the visions
and values of a pioneering practice of land reappropriation and citizens’ interventions in the
urban environment (McKay, 2011; Reynolds,
2008; Tracey, 2007), we still do not have a wider
knowledge of the strategies, political manifestos
and cultural meanings of the multitude of urban
agricultural projects that challenge the urban
form and that could be inscribed within the constellation of the food justice movement (for a few
exceptions, see Block et al., 2012; Gottlieb and
Joshi, 2010; Tornaghi, 2011, 2012b; Wekerle,
2004). In a recent contribution, Haeg (2010)
looks into the meaning of front lawns in American suburbs, tracking their origins in the English
front garden, and details the first experiments in
edible estates in the American urban sprawl.
Despite being more like a catalogue of an art
intervention rather than an academic inquiry into
UA, the book starts to question the legacy of
urban models on urban and suburban forms of
dwelling and is a good start for exploring how
food-growing initiatives are shaped by material
opportunities and the cultural background
embedded in the existing urban form.
A transversal reading of this literature, I
argue, and a interdisciplinary research into land
enclosures, food regimes and planning systems,
should be the first step for a critical geography
of UA and could help to track and expose the
trajectory that has led to overregulated land
management, uneven and unjust land distribution, and the forms of people’s disempowerment
which have contributed to the current land cultivation setting and the autocracy of the urban
form.
2 The blurred line between leisure
gardening and food cultivation
A second area of inquiry which needs development in the direction of a critical geography
revolves around the cultural and political meaning of gardening. Approaching the field from
this perspective we encounter a greater amount
of literature, mainly among gardening books
and health policy reports, which give accounts
of the increased interest in the promotion of
open gardens and garden visiting, such as the
new rhetoric of ludic and pedagogic gardens
in France (Jones, 2005), as well as the promotion of gardening within educational institutions or social services programmes (Bock and
Caraher, 2012). These contributions, however,
tend to focus more on the benefits of experiencing an established garden than on the dynamics
of its establishment. We therefore know very little of the drivers of this increasingly popular
practice, the enabling and constraining role of
local institutions in different policy fields (not
only health, but more specifically the environment and planning sectors), the changing demographics of the actors involved as promoters and
as users, their enacted or inherited land allocation models, the use they actually make of the
produce, the intermingling of (and sometimes tension between) leisure and economical needs, mental benefits and physical health, environmental
ethics and social justice principles, their food
preferences and environmental ‘aesthetics’.
Tornaghi 557
While these elements are interwoven in practice, the literature tends to split along a line
which separates gardening from agriculture, and
urban gardens from the various other forms in
which urban agricultural practices take shape
(indoor growing, vertical and rooftop gardens,
peri-urban farming, etc.). This division, along
with the use of an implicit definition of ‘garden’
as either a private enclosed garden or a public
park, leaves out of the picture urban agricultural
uses of liminal spaces, and so not only entails a
disconnection in the recursive model of space
and society, leaving unquestioned the sociopolitical history of the urban form and disregarding
the empowering element of land access, but
also tends to ignore the lines along which alternative aesthetics, leisure practices or radical
political projects develop through the means
of UA, reimagining and reinventing the urban
form and its management (Tornaghi, 2011).
To borrow an expression from Hodgkinson
(2005: 67), ‘in maintaining your own patch of
earth, you escape the world of money, governments, supermarkets ... you have escaped the
constriction of the wage economy ... digging is
anarchy ... anarchy in action’. The pioneering
‘Incredible Edible Todmorden’ (UK), with its
cultivated street verges and small patches of land
in cemeteries, school yards and police stations, is
one of the most emblematic cases in this field,
demonstrating that mindset change can start from
an act of guerrilla gardening in a municipal flowerbed, and urban food production, reconciling
gardening and agriculture, can become mainstream in public space management.
I am therefore advocating a transdisciplinary
and analytical reconnection of the analysis of
gardening for its leisure, educational and therapeutic benefits on the one hand (i.e. in Bhatti
and Church, 2000; Davis and Middleton,
2012; Jamison, 1985; Jones, 2005; O’Brien,
2010b; Wakefield et al., 2007) and the spatiality
of radical, informal, grassroots practices of contestation, land appropriation, food sovereignty,
back-to-the-land movements and recreation of
commons on the other (Blomley, 2004; Federici
and Haiven, 2009; Halfacree, 2006; Kaufman
and Bailkey, 2000; Pasquali, 2006).
A line of reconnection could, for example,
explore the space of radical urban agricultural
alternatives within mainstream forms of leisure
gardening, landscape aesthetics and the management of the urban natural environment. To
what degree, for example, have permaculture
principles for agroforestry and edible forest gardens permeated public urban park design? To
what extent are agroecology principles being
spread through schools’ and health services’
gardens? Can we identify emerging forms of
re-commoning urban land within alternative
approaches to leisure and health, such as in public healing gardens?
3 From food ethics to urban agricultural
systems: reconnecting consumption
patterns and land access
A third area of relevance for a critical geography
of UA emerges at the intersection of several
well-developed analytical streams around ethical
foodscapes (Morgan, 2009), food ascetics (Osti,
2006), alternative food networks (Harris, 2009)
and more generally a geography of food (Cook
et al., 2008). While these contributions are
extremely interesting for an understanding of the
market relations around smallholdings and urban
food producers, most of this literature tends to
ignore emerging urban agricultural practices and
their embeddedness in wider ethical views of
which consumption is just one end. How are
urban agricultural practices effectively changing
the consumption patterns of their activists? What
is the causal role of land access and environmental ethical positions in determining consumption
choices? There are of course a few exceptions to
the mainstream food literature approach, such as
works by Cockrall-King (2012), Kneafsey et al.
(2008) and Steel (2008), which provide tentative
analysis of several forms of reconnection between producers and consumers. However, when
558 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
it comes to understanding the current consumption models which lead towards poor diets or disconnection from food production, these studies
tend to focus mainly on the industrialization of
agriculture and to ignore the enabling and constraining effects of access to land or community
gardens in consumption patterns and choices.
The ongoing history of urban development, land
enclosure, land struggles and land claims is usually
left out of the picture. However, recent research on
UA is showing a very strong connection between
urban agriculturalists and the activists of food
ethics/food sovereignty movements (Gottlieb and
Joshi, 2010; Haiven, 2009; Tornaghi, 2011). A
disconnection between land access, food production and food consumption patterns can
also be observed within the policy field. While
urban food-growing is present in more than
one policy document in cities like London,
Bristol or Brighton, there are local administrations where this focus is very patchy. Take the
example of Leeds, in the UK: while the council is actively promoting UA by making park
land available to community groups, its climate
change strategy does not mention food waste,
food production and urban food allocation strategies. Within a society used to separating gardening as a leisure activity and agriculture as a
profession to which food production is delegated
entirely, this disconnection is not surprising. UA
is still very little understood as something which
has to do with the food we eat. In the same light
we can read two documents – ‘Land use futures’
and ‘Global food and farming futures’ – recently
released by Foresight (2010, 2011), the research
and consultancy agency commissioned by the
UK government: UA does not appear even as a
remote possibility.
Nonetheless there are a number of recent UA
initiatives, even promoted by local government
officials, as well documented by Nordahl
(2009), which are motivated by food ethics and
a commitment to food justice, and which are
fighting food deserts and urban poverty by initiating urban agricultural projects in interstitial urban
sites. Lyson (2004) points out the role community
and urban gardens play not only in re-skilling and
employment opportunities, but as nurturing
devices for rebuilding vital communities and
community-led food and agriculture systems. In
the same vein is the work of the Chicago Food
Policy Advisory Council, which according to
Allen (2010) is working around urban farming
as a ‘key in the reclamation of an Earth- and
ecology-based value system’, where communities are involved in producing and distributing
their own food, and their sovereignty over land
and water is the main principle in making the
project work (p. 140). While these are all excellent examples of projects and policies able to link
an ethical approach to food production, allocation
and consumption with the basic starting point of
land access and the establishment of UA projects,
the connection (and causal effects) between availability of land and the development of an ethic of
food is generally barely a matter of inquiry within
these analytical contributions.
A critical geography of UA would therefore
not only complement a geography of food and
studies on food cultures and consumption, but
also emerge as a promising field for exploring the
generative potential of urban environments – and
UA projects in particular – in creating the material and educational opportunities for becoming
re-activators of reconnections between food production, ethics and consumption.
This stream would also point towards the need
for more integrated and interdisciplinary work
between the fields of food planning, urban planning and land rights to enable the construction of
forward-looking urban agricultural systems, in
the direction of ecological intensification which
Bohn and Viljoen (2005) have depicted well.
4 The ‘green turn’ and the place
of urban agriculture
A fourth area of inquiry has to do with the relationship between UA and the rhetoric of the sustainable city. Most of these urban agricultural
Tornaghi 559
practices – either grassroots or institutional – are
emerging in dialogue with – or as a challenge to –
the current western rhetoric on the sustainable
city. We could refer to these discourses as
a new ‘green turn’ or ‘ecological turn’ that
appear to be at least as pervasive as the ‘cultural turn’ in urban policies, in place-making
and built-environment studies, in university
curricula and in media and popular discourses.
They generally encompass categories such as
ecological footprints, community resilience
and energy efficiency.
Among the most likely users of these discourses are the promoters of so-called ‘sustainable development’ and urban ecological
security. Many new eco-settlements and buildings, for example, integrate some allotment
facilities or growing spaces, although these are
sometimes very limited or merely symbolic.
An example is the ‘One Brighton’ new development, in central Brighton (UK), which has a few
1-m2 roof allotments (rented for something like
250 times the price of an equivalent size of land
in a municipal allotment), and a number of landscaped green spaces which recall the sharp
description of Cle´ment (2005: 75), where nature
is treated as an object which can be handled,
shaped and machinated without any clue about
its living essence and biological balance.
Equally embedded in the rhetoric of sustainable living are many eco-towns, (like the four
British ones currently under construction)
planned to be built on mostly green land, which
trade better-insulated homes with cultivable
roof gardens or patches of land for a more intensive car-dependent living.
On a more positive note, we see a wide range
of community gardens and allotments, permaculture sites and landshare projects within the Transition Town network that all variously refer to
more socially just and/or environmentally sustainable forms of urban living (Girardet, 2006).
While many of these are certainly more critical
of the ‘green wash’ of sustainable developers and
are genuinely seeking to reduce ecological
footprints (Pinkerton and Hopkins, 2009) or
increase community cohesion (Mares and Penˇa,
2010), a vast amount of them tend rather to represent forms of small-scale economic ‘entrepreneurialism’ within the available pots of charity
and lottery funds, primarily with the intention
of seeking an income in times of financial crisis,
rather than promoting radically alternative forms
of urban living. This is often the case within
artist-led projects, which are now turning their
ability to challenge, surprise and engage the public into gardening projects that are better funded
than the performing and public arts. When we
assess these initiatives more substantially for the
type of sustainability that they pursue, a series of
issues emerge. The first one is the localism/selfsufficiency agenda – as in the transition initiatives
described by Mason and Whitehead (2012) –
which underestimate the potential benefits of an
alliance with international fair trade to defeat the
primacy of the agro-food industry; or, as in the
case of most public policy in this field, look into
food security and food self-sufficiency not with
a view to making a fairer use of the planet’s
resources, but more simply to ensure that the
underlying growth-oriented economic model can
continue its smooth reproduction.
Another danger is the risk of becoming
trapped in planning models, such as the lowdensity garden city model or its recent revisitation as agrarian urbanism (Duany, 2011; Van
der Schans and Wiskerke, 2012) – which, on a
planet with a fast-growing population, could
never represent a living solution for everyone,
but rather a privilege for a few. The concept
of density itself is in fact a matter of debate
within the advocates of the UA-led ecological
intensification (Viljoen, 2005).
As critical geographers we are called to
inquire deeper into what models of justice and
sustainability these initiatives are based on.
While many of these food-growing projects are
actually providing access to land for some social
groups, this does not always translate into a fairly
accessible resource for the whole population,
560 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
lacking therefore in terms of distributional justice. Nor does this new provision always embed
an ethic of procedural justice, that is to say a
facilitated wider public participation in the process of defining the scale and location of these
newly available food-growing spaces and projects. Following Whitehead (2009) we could go
even further, and try to assess the extent to which
they promote an embodied capability through a
‘ready-to-hand’ space which improves socioenvironmental justice in the everyday life of
urban communities.
The wide critical literature on urban metabolism (Broto et al., 2011; Gandy, 2004; Schneider and McMichael, 2010), the production of
nature (Swyngedouw, 2009), ecological gentrification (Dooling, 2009) and eco-imperialism
(Shiva, 2008) framed within a cultural political
ecology approach (Heynen and Swyngedouw,
2003; Heynen et al., 2006) is an excellent starting point to build a critical geography of UA
which looks beyond the western, pro-growth
and market-driven definition of sustainability,
and investigate alternative paradigms such as
agroecology and agroforestry (Gliessman,
2012) and its suitability for an urban context.
III Towards a critical geography
of urban agriculture: a research
agenda
Drawing on the existing literature and the range
of emerging urban agricultural practices, in the
previous section we identified four areas of
inquiry and signification which pose a number
of questions. Building on these four analytical
areas, I would like now to draft a research
agenda for a critical geography of UA, inspired
by Marcuse’s proposition for a critical inquiry
into the right to the city: ‘expose, propose, politicize’ (Marcuse, 2009).
We need a geography of UA which goes
beyond the naive and unproblematic representation of urban food production practices, able to
expose the socio-environmental exclusionary
dynamics which are embedded into them. Given
the nature of these practices, we also need a
body of theory which is able to engage in
a transdisciplinary dialogue with the field of
policy-making and civil society to propose alternatives and repoliticize a neglected field of urban
living. By ‘transdisciplinarity’ (Moulaert et al.,
2013) I mean a practice of inquiry which goes
beyond academic disciplines and aims to create
a dialogue with civil society organizations to
forge alternatives.
The discussion of the existing literature on
UA across different disciplinary fields, which
I have outlined above, has identified the forms
of disempowerment, conceptual and practical
disconnections, and rhetorical discourses which
limit and constrain the radical potential of UA
as a vector of change. From this discussion we
can build a tentative research agenda for a critical geography of UA.
A first research area could be an exploration
of the cultural and political meanings of urban
agricultural initiatives in different historical
conjunctures and urban contexts in the Global
North. This research track should first look for
the specific forms of land regulation and ownership which determine the set of constraints and
opportunities which shapes the initiatives in
their contexts, and then focus on the analysis
of emerging urban agricultural practices, exposing their objectives, values, meanings and
claims. Its driving questions should be: why is
UA a growing practice at the current time?
What kinds of UA projects are emerging? Who
has access to the land? What are the objectives
of UA practitioners? Are they driven by material need (recession, food price hikes, poverty,
etc.), economic self-interest (business opportunity) and/or environmental concerns (food
miles, climate change)? Or is this a deeper manifestation of urban life distress or the search for
new community ties?
The main goal of this first track should be the
exposition of the link between the specific contextual sociopolitical arrangements of the host
Tornaghi 561
society, including its governance, food regimes
and mainstream economic structure, and the
goals of urban agricultural projects in relation
to – or detachment from – them. In short, the specific place of UA initiatives within a cultural
political ecology analysis.
Framing the analysis in the structure-agency
debate and theoretical approaches of political
ecology, this research area could extend its
scope identifying the specific policy challenges that urban agricultural projects raise,
such as the current mechanisms for land allocation and the current configuration of land distribution, the competing claims for land, or
the externality effects on the environment.
Crucial questions will be: how is UA conceptualized in the political sphere? What role does
it play in the arguments of dismantling the welfare state, through the forms of self-sufficiency
and new localism? How are these views influencing the understanding of UA as an emerging multifaceted ‘urban culture’? What role
does it play in the current restructuring and
rescaling of urban ecological security and in
the changing geopolitical configurations
between cities and countries?
Further to a location in context, a second suggested research stream is a systematic work of
exposure of the socio-environmental injustice
and exclusionary dynamics in place within
urban agricultural initiatives. The focus of this
research area should be the understanding of the
potential – or actually occurring – exclusionary
and inclusionary dynamics of UA; for example,
the extent to which they promote social equality, socio-environmental justice, poverty alleviation or community participation. While
these questions might seem to fall outside the
remit of a geographical approach, I believe this
second line of inquiry can show the role of UA
in tackling specific localized urban problems.
Digging into the rhetoric of sustainability and
inclusion, the main driving questions will be:
how are social cohesion and social exclusion
promoted and alleviated through UA? What is
the potential for food-growing in the city? What
productivity rates, skills and infrastructures can
make UA a key tool for community resilience to
food deserts, food poverty and to the current
economic crisis? While I do not believe the
solutions to these problems – nor to the one of
ecological security – can and should be sought
after through an attempt at self-sufficiency, I
do believe that UA intensively practised in an
urban environment can create the necessary premises for a serious reconsideration of the structural elements which determine the functional
organization of urban space, people’s consumption behaviours and their dependency on the
current food regimes.
A third research area is interdisciplinary in
nature and could bridge reflections on the innovative content of these practices as pioneering
new spatial arrangement, forms of land management and urban design on the one hand, and
their attempts to experiment with the construction of new social bonds on the other. Looking
at the intersection of these two fields – the built
and the social environments – this research
area would aim at proposing alternative models
for a critical envisioning of post-capitalist,
de-growth inspired urban living. This track
would not only offer an overview of projects
which are doing UA via alternative forms of
land management (i.e. new urban commons and
community land trusts; innovative forms of
integration between food production and dwelling; new spatial arrangements for the materialization of an urban abundance in public space)
but would also investigate to what extent these
experiences are embedded within wider visions
and struggles. What role does UA play in the
various attempts to regain control over the
means of reproduction of social life? What is
their potential to constitute an alternative for
larger societies? What implications do these
models suggest for the reorganization of urban
communities in ways that are built on ecologically and socially just forms of living? What are
the cultural, ecological, economical, political
562 Progress in Human Geography 38(4)
and philosophical models which inform these
initiatives, and what geography and radical alternatives are they building? This research stream
could start from the provocative work of Atkinson (2013), McClintock (2013) and Saed (2012).
A final, fourth research area could engage in
a political ecology inspired action-research,
along the lines suggested by Blaikie (2012).
Engaging in the critical field of policy-making,
the research could experiment with the use of
participatory tools to bridge the communication
divide between grassroots groups and policymakers. This final research area would be aimed
atrepoliticizing the role of UA in the urban structure. Within this research stream we could, for
example, explore why grassroots-based foodsovereignty movements and government-based
community-growing campaigns are exponentially growing with little or nothing in common.
What is the potential of participatory research
in creating a meeting space for knowledge sharing and for exposing diverging perspectives with
the ambition of overcoming these differences?
While the aim of repoliticizing our right to food
and land – in line with a critical geography of
UA – is intuitively conflicting with the necessarily cautious process of participatory research in
the field of policy-making, the time seems ripe
for experimenting with planting seeds of change
out of their usual fields.
IV Conclusions
In this paper I tried to define the scope and an
initial agenda for a critical geography of UA. I
started this task with an overview of the discourses currently used in media and policy to
describe the benefits of UA. I then raised some
doubts, questioned these discourses and identified potential exclusionary dynamics or hidden
aims which reveal how regressive and neoliberal agendas, new forms of enclosures, or the
reproduction of social inequality can become
real through urban agricultural projects. On the
basis of these driving questions, I then provided
a frame for the rest of the paper, by explaining
why I claim we need a critical and a geographical analysis of this increasingly popular practice. Two main motivations call for a ‘spatial’
and eminently urban analysis of food cultivation. The first is an interest in the ongoing process of place-making, the role that UA plays
within this historical trajectory and the potential
it embodies for a radical retheorization and reorganization of urban functions. The second motivation looks more widely at the relationship
between the maintenance of the status quo of
neoliberal cities and the geopolitics of food:
given the pace and the scale at which urban food
security is resulting in land grabbing, the role of
UA as a large-scale alternative, or at least as an
ethical food-sourcing choice, becomes more
and more relevant. In section II, I proceeded
with an analysis of the existing literature,
divided into four subsections, in order to show
existing knowledge gaps, possible reconnections or new forms of signification which do not
find a proper theorization, highlighting forms of
injustice and directions for new research. In section III, I reorganized these questions in four
areas which would build the backbone for a critical geography of UA. The first two, respectively looking at a larger or smaller scale of
meanings and relations in the making of UA, are
predominantly focused on analysing and exposing the variety of meanings, forms, challenges
or conflicts that characterize urban agricultural
projects in their specific contexts. The third
identified research area is predominantly dedicated to proposing and questioning alternatives
to neoliberal urbanism and its socio-economic
organization, which are being carried out
through UA, and to understanding their alternative cultural, political or philosophical models.
The fourth and final research area, which
includes also a methodological prescription, is
more clearly aimed at repoliticizing the role of
UA, suggesting working alongside grassroots
initiatives and engaging with the field of policy-making.
Tornaghi 563
To conclude this paper, I would like to reflect
on what might be the purpose of a critical geography of UA once it is under way. While a large
part of this paper has been dedicated to identifying themes for a research agenda, I am not advocating a new subdiscipline which merely
aggregates under its umbrella a number of small,
in-depth, empirical accounts, organized thematically. Nor it is my intention to call for comparative research and large generalizations on
what UA in the Global North might look like.
As for any other geography, however, it is useful to reflect on how different scalar and methodological approaches might relate to each
other. To this end, I want to recall the work of
Marcuse and Brenner on critical urban theory
which frames this paper. Each has been calling
for research committed to exposing forms of
injustice and exclusion, as well as for attempts
to politicize, empower and identify alternatives.
I believe that to achieve these aims micro and
macro approaches are complementary.
On the one hand, narrowly focused and contextualized case studies would provide a muchneeded critical analysis in a field that is prone to
be exploited as a tool for the regeneration of
capital, as a new spatial fix or just as another
opportunity for urban enclosure. At the same
time, case-study-based research can also highlight examples where UA counteracts specific
‘mechanisms of neoliberal localization’ (Brenner
and Theodore, 2002: 368–375) that have characterized neoliberal urbanism in the last decades:
for example, new increased intra-national and
regional collaboration around new food systems;
virtuous closed-loop urban metabolic cycles; and
initiatives that support social reproduction and
food sovereignty, that re-engage local communities in emancipatory place-making, or that
rescale the food supply chain. UA, for its ability
to reconnect the sphere of reproduction to its ecological and physical substrate, opens important
windows of opportunity for experimenting with
radical mechanisms of territorial development
and urban living.
On the other hand, while I am generally sceptical about the benefits of comparative endeavours for the sake of generalization, I believe
that the broader view of the constellation of
UA projects that this critical geography will
allow to emerge across regions or countries, and
how these projects can interlink and articulate at
specific geographical scales – something along
the lines of Brenner and Theodore’s (2002)
systematization of the moments of neoliberal
creation and destruction – will be extremely
useful. I believe this will facilitate the equally
necessary work of identifying creative and
innovative projects, mapping successful alternatives, and weaving new reconnections, that
can help to imagine and forge new directions
for socio-environmentally just cities.
